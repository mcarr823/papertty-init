# Short URLs

The files in this directory call the installer scripts hosted on GitHub.

The intention is for these files to be uploaded to other websites with shorter domains.

That way papertty-init can be run from a shorter URL on a different domain, but still call the latest version of the installer from GitHub.

ie. You run one of these scripts on another domain, such as sh.mcarr.dev, which then triggers the actual installer from GitHub at raw.githubusercontent.com/mcarr823/papertty-init/main/
